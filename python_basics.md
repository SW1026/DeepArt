# Python Basics

## Why Python?

[Python](https://python.org) is a general-purpose programming language that is popular and easy to use. For new programmers, it is a great choice as a first programming language. In fact, more and more university CS departments are centering their introductory courses around Python.

For a summary of reasons to move from Matlab to Python, please read [this post](https://stevetjoa.com/305).

This page on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/programming-languages/python) provides some more great reasons to use Python, along with resources for getting started.

## Tutorial

If you are new to Python, please follow [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html).

For the purposes of this workshop, be sure you understand the following sections:

- Section 3: An Informal Introduction to Python
    - numbers: `int`, `float`
    - strings
    - lists
- Section 4: More Control Flow Tools
    - `if` statements
    - `for` statements
    - `range`
    - functions
- Section 5: Data Structures
    - list comprehensions
    - tuples
    - dictionaries
    - looping techniques

While the other sections are useful, you can learn them along the way.

## Package Installation

To follow the material on this site, you will need to install additional Python packages.

Follow the instructions on the [GitHub repository `README`](https://github.com/stevetjoa/stanford-mir#how-to-use-this-repo).

1.  If youâ€™re totally new, the simplest solution is to download and install [Anaconda for Python 2 (2.7)](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), not Python 3. 
    
2.  Install [librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/install.html) and [ffmpeg](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/install.html#ffmpeg).

You will also probably want to [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). pip is the recommended tool for installing most other Python packages.
